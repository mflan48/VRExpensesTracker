# Virtual Reality Expense Tracker
A virtual reality program that allows users to visualize their expenses. The user can create, edit, or delete "columns" of money. In create mode, the user can spawn in columns with a default value. In edit mode, the user can select columns and edit the amount in the columns. In delete mode the users can remove columns that are no longer needed.
